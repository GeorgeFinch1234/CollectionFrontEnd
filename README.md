# Front End Game Collection
This repository is the first part of a two-part project developed during my internship at Toru Digital. The project was completed independently and serves as the front-end for a board game collection website.
The application is built with Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It communicates with a backend API (developed in Part Two of the project) to retrieve and display collection data. The backend API can be found here: [part 2](https://github.com/GeorgeFinch1234/Collectionbackend).
## Goal
The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS and Nuxt during my internship. It provided an opportunity to independently apply these technologies in building a real-world web application.
